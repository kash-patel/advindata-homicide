    "Homicide is one of those things that's so far removed from most of our lives in Western countries that it's easy to sensationalize it to an absurd degree. Just look at all the detective shows (which I admit I enjoy) or serial killer docu-series available now. Nevertheless, the act of taking a human life is so _grotesque_ that there has to be some rhyme or reason to it (or so one hopes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The practical implications of that existence (again, hopefully) of motive are in the actual solving of the case and arresting the perpetrators, and this is the thing I was originally interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used two datasets of homicide case data. The first was compiled by a team at [_The Washington Post_](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides) [1], covering 52,000 hommicides in 50 of the largest cities in the United States, from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2017. The accompanying [story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/where-murders-go-unsolved/) [2] focuses on the causes and impacts of unsolved homicides and the regions with low homicide arrest rates. The second is from the [Murder Accountability Project](https://www.murderdata.org/p/data-docs.html) [3], dowloaded September 19, 2023, which covers over ten times as many homicides, from 1985 to the present.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hope here was that combining the two datasets would lead to a clearer picture of homicide case closes and arrests than either dataset could provide individually. During the data prepping, however, I quickly encountered a challenge that piqued my interest; so, I followed my curiosity, and expanded this would-be small project into a series."

    "<span style=\"color: red\">Note:</span> It's important not to make the sample size too large or run the `sample()` method too many times if you intend to do any kind of hypothesis testing. Ideally, one would be able to access mutiple datasets from the same source, perform data analysis on one and generate hypotheses to test, and use the others for testing those hypotheses, with one dataset per hypothesis, to avoid the multiple-comparisons problem. Fortunately, this project will not require any hypothesis testing, so we can get as familiar with the data as we want. We will split it into train and test sections in the future, however, to build and tune machine-learning models.\n",

    "2,560 rows is less than 1% of the total number of records in the MAP dataset, which is not bad (this isn't the total number of invalid dates; since I'm only extracting datestrings I can change, I ignored all datestrings that are empty). Still, ideally all dates would be recorded accurately and in the same format, so I still think it's worth taking some time to clean them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that the [MAP data dictionary](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lo6tgo8nnbpqeru/MAPdefinitionsSHR.pdf) [4] specifies the datestrings as having the format \"mmddyy\"; that is, the first two characters represent the month, the middle two represent the day, and the last two represent the year. However, not all the datetsrings have six characters, and in my effort to clean them up, I made two assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. That the last two characters always represents the year; and\n",
    "2. That the month always precedes the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `correct_datestrings()` function below is pretty simple: if the datestring has four characters, it assumes that the first two represent the month and day, and the last two represent the year (e.g. \"4620\" is April 6, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "If, on the other hand, the datestring has five characters, things are a bit more complicated. For instance, the datestring \"12417\" could be corrected to either \"012417\" (January 24, 2017) or \"120417\" (December 4, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the most accurate way to figure out what the correct date is to compare the dates in records above and below the record in question. However, even that isn't foolproof: the dates represented by the datestrings I'm correcting are the record file dates, which are updated when a change (or `Adjustment`, as recorded in the `ActionType` column) is made to the record. So, if a record is preceded by a case which was filed on January 23, 2017 and succeeded by a case filed January 25, 2017, the record could have a file date of December 4, 2017 if it was adjusted on that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why not simply check the `ActionType` column of the record to see if it was adjusted? Well, an adjustment could also have been made the same day the record was filed, so deciding on an interpretation of a datestring based _purely_ on that would result in an incorrect date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I'm not sure that only the `Adjustment` value of `ActionType` corresponds to a change in the record, because the data dictionary doesn't tell us what counts as a \"normal\" update and what counts as an adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the five-character-datestring problem I used a combination of checks, in a series of if-elif-else statements. Here's the logic behind them:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, take the datestring \"50216\". Obviously, \"50\" can't be the month number since there are only twelve of those, so the correct datestring must be \"050216\" --- May 2, 2016. This is one strategy I used to handle five-character datestrings: if the number formed by the first two characters exceeds 12, stick a zero at the front of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, all records in the MAP dataset have an ID, in which is encoded the year and month the record was initially filed, which can be used as a reference. For instance, a case with an ID like \"202105045...\" (the 45th incident in May, 2021) can't have the datestring \"11221\" be corrected to \"011221\" (January 12, 2021) since a record can't have been filed ... before it was filed. So, I know to correct \"11221\" to \"110221\" (November 2, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "All other datestrings I replaced with a \" \", since there is no purely logical way to verify which date they correspond to. For example, take ID \"202101...\" and datestring \"10121\". Even the `ActionType` doesn't tell me much, since the MAP data dictionary doesn't specify what, exactly, counts as a \"normal\" update and what counts as an adjustment."

    "Much like in the previous version, there are two matches: the first is [the accidental killing of a 26-year-old woman by her three-year-old son](https://www.newson6.com/story/5e3629382f69d76f6204ae65/tulsa-police:-3yearold-accidentally-shot-killed-mother) [6], and the second is the murder of Amanda Douglas. Now we can see why neither of these showed up in the merged dataset: the `File Date` is different, and corresponds to an `Adjustment`, according to the `Action` column. Interestingly, Douglas' murder is still recorded as unsolved in the MAP dataset as of February 2, 2015, despite the man believed to have killed Douglas along with another woman, Jennifer Sanders, having been arrested in January 2015, according to the linked news story [5]."

In a future project, I want to see if I can get data from the CDE to compare with the MAP dataset and/or update outdated information, like the fact that the record of the murder of Amanda Douglas was not updated as closed in the MAP dataset, despite the perpetrator having been arrested in 2015.\n",

This may account for some of the missing file dates in the MAP dataset.\n",

This could explain some of the discrepancy between the _Post_ and MAP datasets: the _Post_ data was accessed \"by hand,\" so to speak, so it may reference sources beyond FBI records, whereas the MAP dataset relies heavily on FBI records for its data.\n",

    "It appears that the dataset compiled by the _Washington Post_ team is an anomaly; indeed, the GitHub page which hosts the dataset [1] indicates that the data came from a variety of sources, digital and analog. Compiling it all into one dataset must have taken an enormous amount of effort. It does, however, make one wonder what stands in the way of building a robust, consistent system of homicide (or any other crime) data collection, both on national and international levels, and what the social impacts of such a system would be."
